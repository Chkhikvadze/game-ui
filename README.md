## IDE

We encourage you to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Please install the following plugins:

- Code Spell Checker
- ESLint
- EditorConfig
- Prettier [See Installing for VSCode, WebStorm and others](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html)

## Node Version

We use `NVM` to manage the Node version. You can install it [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

Version is specified in `.nvmrc` file. Current version is `v18.10.0`

After installing NVM, run the following command to install the Node version used in this project:

```bash
nvm install
nvm use
```

## Install Dependencies

We use `yarn` to manage the dependencies. You can install it by running the following command and then install dependencies:

```bash
npm install -g yarn
yarn # or yarn install
```

## Committing

We use [Commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) to lint our commit messages. This ensures that we have consistent commit messages.

Example of a good commit message:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add new button component"
```

Commit Types:
